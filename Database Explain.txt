All the database is saved in a file called project.db. There are total 11 hashtables in the database.
Example: Index ----> Value
1. ID of the url ----> url
2. url                  ----> ID of the url
3. ID of the url  ----> Title
4. ID of the url  ----> Content length
5. ID of the url  ----> Last modified date
6. ID of the url  ----> Childlink
7. ID of the url  ----> Parentlink
8. ID of the url  ----> Term and frequency
9. Term              ----> ID of the url
10. ID of the url----> Title term and frequency
11.Title term      ----> ID of the url 

ID of the url is used as index for most of the hashtable. To increase weight calculation, term to ID and ID to term is constructed seperatly in our design.
